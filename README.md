WhatsApp Automation for Restaurant & Hotel Booking (n8n)

Overview :

This project is a WhatsApp-based automation system built with n8n that enables restaurants and hotels to manage food orders and room bookings through conversational WhatsApp chats. The system is location-aware, payment-enabled, and integrated with Google Sheets for data storage and reporting.

Customers can browse menus or room options, place orders or bookings, make UPI/QR payments, and leave reviews — all within WhatsApp. Conversations are stored and summarized to create meaningful customer profiles and improve future interactions.
